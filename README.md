<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

You can see here the
[Repo](https://github.com/EpitechMscProPromo2025/T-POO-700-NAN_9)

Or the [Mirror](https://github.com/tistech0/GoTime) of the project were we can use the github actions

This is the first Epitech project in the MSc cursus. This project aims at creating a time manager app.

#### To give you some context :

_We are in Gotham city and the people have to repair all the batman destruction. They do a lot of extra time and work at night. They need a time manager to manage their time and their teams. That's why we created GoTime._

_GoTime is a time manager to manage your time and your teams. There is 3 categories of users : User, Manager, Global manager. Each category of user has different rights on the website._

_The app give you the opportunity to check-up every day and keep a trace of your work. If it's an extra time or if it's a night time, it's rensured that you will be paid for it._

_The app also give you the opportunity to manage your teams. You can create a team, add members to it, and manage the time of each member of your team._

_To help you be the most efficient, the app give you the opportunity to see quickly with the help of graph your time and the time of your teams._

_The service provied also a mobile app to be able to use it everywhere._

#### The project is composed of 7 parts :

- The API in Elixir
- The web app in Vue.js
- The dev ops part with Docker Kubernetes and CI/CD
- The design thinking part with the personas, the user story map, the graphic charter, the maquette and the prototype
- The authentication part with TODO
- The mobile app in TODO
- The security part

## Database Schema

<a href="https://dbdiagram.io/d/6537c193ffbf5169f0588785">
<img src="./clientTimeManager/public/schemaDatabase.png" alt="Database Diagram">
</a>

When we have started the project, we have take a moment to think how our data would be organized. We have decided to use a relational database. We have created a database diagram to use it as a guide during the project. We have used [DbDiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to create it.

## Project management

<a href="https://tasks.office.com/epitechfr.onmicrosoft.com/Home/PlanViews/3zEW8ZEJD02irspfcFwa0JYAEexq?Type=PlanLink&Channel=Link&CreatedTime=638345289978310000">
    <img src="./clientTimeManager/public/Planner.png" alt="Database Diagram">
</a>

For all the project, we wanted to have some kind of project management. We have decided to use [Planner](https://tasks.office.com/epitechfr.onmicrosoft.com/Home/PlanViews/3zEW8ZEJD02irspfcFwa0JYAEexq?Type=PlanLink&Channel=Link&CreatedTime=638345289978310000) to manage our project. We have created tasks and assigned them to the different members of the team. We add a description to each task. We also have a calendar to see the deadlines of the tasks and manage progression and priorities. We also have some bucket to organize our tasks.

---

## Design Thinking

Before starting the project, we did some design thinking to have a better idea of what we wanted to do.

Then, we created 3 personas representing 3 types of user : User, Manager, Global manager. That helped us to have a better idea of what the user would want to do on the website.

<a href="https://github.com/EpitechMscProPromo2025/T-POO-700-NAN_9/tree/main/clientTimeManager/public/TimeManagerPersonas/Persona1.png">

    <img src="./clientTimeManager/public/TimeManagerPersonas/Persona3.png" alt="Persona">
</a>

---

After that we created a user story map for each persona. That helped us to have a better idea of what the user would want to do on the website.

    <img src="./clientTimeManager/public/TimeManagerUserStoryMap/UserStoryMapGlobalManager.png" alt="UserStoryMap" >
</a>

---

We quickly established a graphic charter to have a better idea of what the website feel like. We also created a logo for the website.

<img src="./clientTimeManager/public/chartegraphique.png" alt="Charte Graphique">

---

At the end, we created a maquette and a prototype of the website. That helped us to have a better idea of what the website would look like. And give the possibility to client to have a better idea of what we wanted to do and change some things if they wanted to.

<img src="./clientTimeManager/public/Maquette.png" alt="Maquette">

Here is the link to the [maquette](https://www.figma.com/file/4Z0U05BFBMhuL2TE7993MC/Time-Manager-Maquette?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=KPvtWUbGCXgla5f3-1)

After all of that, we were ready to start the project.
