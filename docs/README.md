## Design Thinking

Before starting the project, we did some design thinking to have a better idea of what we wanted to do.

Then, we created 3 personas representing 3 types of user : User, Manager, Global manager. That helped us to have a better idea of what the user would want to do on the website.

After that we created a user story map for each persona. That helped us to have a better idea of what the user would want to do on the website.

We quickly established a graphic charter to have a better idea of what the website feel like. We also created a logo for the website.

At the end, we created a maquette and a prototype of the website. That helped us to have a better idea of what the website would look like. And give the possibility to client to have a better idea of what we wanted to do and change some things if they wanted to.
